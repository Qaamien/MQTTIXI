-Mosquitto is open source MQTT broker which you can run on Raspberry pi-

// Do your own research around MQTT brokers if those are something you want to use

// These are install instructions which i found from internet, 
// i do not take any responsibility if these cause any damage
// when you install or use broker installed with these instructions!

// after Raspberry pi reboot broker will run allways, because installation makes it systemd service.

// To install Mosquitto on your Raspberry Pi type on terminal: 

sudo apt-get install mosquitto
sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf

// after that last command it will open text file,
// remove last line "include_dir /etc/mosquitto/conf.d"

// and replace that with these three lines: 

allow_anonymous false
password_file /etc/mosquitto/pwfile
listener 1883

// first it requires that you have to use username and password
// and set brokers port = 1883

// press Ctrl + x to exit and choose YES when it ask do you want to save changes

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

// type this line next, and replace "username" with username which you want to use on your broker and hit enter

sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/pwfile username

// then it ask password you want to use

// after that it is done, just type

sudo reboot

// It will restart your Raspberry pi

// when Raspberry pi starts broker will automaticly start because installation makes it systemd service 

// To use broker, open two terminals, use first one to subscribe to topic, replace username and password
// Use second one to publish message to topic, it will appear in first terminal because both use same topic "dev/test". 

mosquitto_sub -d -u username -P password -t "dev/test"
mosquitto_pub -d -u username -P password -t "dev/test" -m "Hello world"

// to change topic replace: -t "dev/test" with any topic name which you want to use.

// Have fun!
